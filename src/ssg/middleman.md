    Thomas Reynolds came to SSGs from a slightly different angle: "I started Middleman basically to make my life building email templates a little more simple and [DRY]". While building email templates was Middleman's initial use case, the principles of reducing complexity and repetition made it a popular alternative to Jekyll.

If you were coming from Ruby on Rails or Sinatra, Middleman would feel right at home with its ERB templating system and Ruby-based configuration. Until 3.0, Middleman was actually built on the Sinatra Ruby framework.

Where Middleman shone was in its consistency and supporting features. While Jekyll had many different maintainers, Thomas has always been at the helm of Middleman, creating a more cohesive platform. Features such as i18n, minifying, multiple templating languages, and CDN integration help set it apart.

Middleman enjoyed success with companies such as Mailchimp, Thoughtbot, and Vox Media. Thoughtbot used Middleman to rapidly spin up small landing page websites for clients. They also used it as their blog platform for a couple of years, driven by the performance of static sites and the improved contribution and review workflows enabled by Git.
