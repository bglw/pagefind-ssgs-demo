    The release of Gatsby.js started a seismic shift with regards to what an SSG could be. Until now, SSGs had mainly focused on building HTML from source files. Kyle Mathew's vision was to flip this on its head. He thought of it as pulling content rather than pushing:

    "when you start working on more complex sites, you really start to miss the flexibility of building a database-driven site. With a database, all your data is available to query against in any fashion that you'd like. Whatever bits of data you need to assemble a page, you can pull in. You want to create author pages showing their bio & last 5 posts? It's just a query away."

Gatsby.js completely streamlined sourcing content and data from anywhere: it could be from a static file (like existing SSGs), your database, your CMS, or somewhere else. All this data is available through a GraphQL interface, making it easy to interact with content from multiple sources.

React was already the go-to tool for developers in product development due to its flexibility, simplicity, and ability to power even the largest web products. Gatsby.js capitalized on this popularity and enabled React developers to bring their knowledge and components to informational websites.

Gatsby.js was also the first SSG to blur the line between static and dynamic websites by supporting single-page applications (SPAs) as first-class citizens. It gives developers the best of the static and dynamic:

1. Gatsby.js builds an entirely static website.
2. When a client loads a page, React hydrates the page enabling dynamic interactions.

The developer doesn't need to build these experiences individually. Everything is created from React components.

The idea for Gatsby.js came to Kyle while he was working on his previous start-up, RelateRocket. On the marketing website, he stated that he "wanted to avoid using anything other than React.js." By 2018, Gatsby.js already had over 10k stars on GitHub (Jekyll had around 30k simultaneously but with a much lower trajectory). With this momentum, Kyle teamed up with Sam Bhagwat to form Gatsby Inc., a venture-backed company focused on building cloud infrastructure to push Gatsby.js even further.

Gatsby.js made a monumental change in how we think about SSGs and added a great deal of legitimacy to the space. It currently powers the websites for well-known brands such as Figma, Digital Ocean, Impossible, and National Geographic.
