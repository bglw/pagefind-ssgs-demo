    Tommy Chen was using Octopress on his personal blog and was running into performance issues.

    "[translated from Traditional Chinese] I think every Octopress user must have such troubles â€” as the number of articles increases, the speed of file creation becomes slower and slower. This site has grown to 54 articles, and it takes at least one minute to create a file every time."

He had been messing around with Node.js, and decided to create a Jekyll-inspired prototype using the framework. His prototype took the build time on his blog from one minute on Jekyll down to two seconds. Impressed with the results â€” and who wouldn't be? â€” he spent a month building out the rest of the SSG and released the first version of Hexo.

Hexo wasn't the first JavaScript-based SSG, but it was the first to gain a significant following. It has a similar feature set to Jekyll, a vast number of themes and plugins, and has the ability for deep customization for those familiar with Node.js.
