    Finding the original, grandparent-of-all-grandparents static site generator is a tough undertaking. We know it was created sometime in the 90s, and it was probably an obscure piece of software that only a small group of people knew about.

The earliest I can find is HSC ("HTML Sucks Completely"), which Thomas Aglassinger created in 1996. HSC didn't call itself a static site generator — that term wouldn't be coined until the late 2000s. Instead, it was an "HTML preprocessor," and attempted to address some of the pain points of static HTML:

> HTML is a very clumsy thing: No macros, no include files and several other features lacking.

HSC had typical SSG features like includes and conditional statements. It even had features we don’t commonly see in SSGs, such as validating links & syntax, and automatically adding the width and height to image elements.

HSC was an innovative yet obscure piece of software. While it could perform many functions, dynamic website rendering would still reign supreme over the coming decades.
