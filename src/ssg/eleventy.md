    The story behind how Eleventy got its name must be the sweetest of all the SSGs:

    "Some might think that the name Eleventy is an homage to Spinal Tap (turn it up to eleven) or more directly, Lord of the Rings. I chose it because of a story my grandma Nonnie loved to tell about how I learned to count. Rather than move from ten to eleven like a normal child, I felt it appropriate to use the teen suffix for the numbers eleven and twelve, counting "ten, eleventy-teen, twelvety-teen, thirteen, â€¦" I always liked that story and it seemed as appropriate a reason as any."

Zach Leatherman created Eleventy for three reasons:

1. Flexibility â€” Eleventy is a highly flexible static site generator. It supports almost any templating engine you can dream of, the directory structure is highly configurable, and an extensive plugin ecosystem can extend the framework to whatever you need.
2. Betting on JavaScript â€” JavaScript was an easy choice for Zach due to the enormous npm ecosystem, which can be leveraged for faster build-out and easier maintenance.
3. Not a JavaScript Framework â€” "While Eleventy uses JavaScript in node.js to transform templates into content, importantly (by default) it does not recommend nor force your HTML to include any Eleventy-specific client-side JavaScript."

Soon after launching, Eleventy gained a cult following. There's not a single killer feature driving this adoption, but Eleventy takes some of the best ideas from other SSGs, mitigates their downsides, and ties them together in a well-thought-out package:

- It's highly extensible like Jekyll and Gatsby.
- It has fast build times like Hugo.
- It has a convention-based folder structure similar to Jekyll.
- It can pull in 3rd party data during build like Gatsby.
- It supports shortcodes like Hugo.

Eleventy ranked highly for developer satisfaction in both the 2020 and 2021 Jamstack surveys and boasts vocal community support. It powers websites such as Google's web.dev, CSS-Tricks Conferences, ffconf, and Lookback.
