    Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, released his take on a Vue-based SSG in 2018 with VuePress. Where Nuxt.js focuses on building web applications, VuePress is all about document-based websites, particularly product documentation.

The default template on VuePress gives you a documentation theme with many bells and whistles, including a customizable navbar, site-wide search, and multi-language support. You can even use Vue components directly in your Markdown.

VuePress 2 is currently in beta and is a significant rework of the framework led by meteorlxy. Improvements include:

- It uses Vue 3
- It's built from the ground up in TypeScript
- It supports either Webpack or Vite as the bundler
