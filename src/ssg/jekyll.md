    Tom Preston-Werner founded GitHub in 2008 with his cofounders Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. 2008 was a busy year for Tom. Nine months after founding GitHub, in December 2008, he launched Jekyll â€” a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

The complexity of existing blogging platforms fueled Tom to create Jekyll.

    I already knew a lot about what I didn't want. I was tired of complicated blogging engines like WordPress and Mephisto. I wanted to write great posts, not style a zillion template pages, moderate comments all day long, and constantly lag behind the latest software release.

Jekyll built on many of the ideas from Nanoc and introduced two now-staple SSG features of its own:

    Front matter â€” Having page metadata in a small YAML snippet at the top of a page's source code.
    "Blog-aware" â€” Just put Markdown files in a folder, and Jekyll will turn it into a blog.

Along with Jekyll, GitHub launched GitHub Pages â€” a free hosting platform for Jekyll websites, which propelled Jekyll to become a household name among web developers.

Developers starting building their personal blogs, documentation, and even some business websites with Jekyll. The inflection point came when Kyle Rush used a Jekyll website to raise $250M for the Obama Campaign, and praised its quick page loads, reduction in page weight, structural flexibility for A/B testing, and the accompanying increase in donations for the campaign. The tides were changing on static. Static was no longer perceived as a limited technology, and SSGs weren't just tools to build personal developer blogs. There was a strong business case for creating static websites.

Jekyll's contributions were dwindling in late 2012 and looked like a dormant future for the SSG powerhouse. That was until Parker Moore wrote an open letter to Tom and became the lead maintainer until 2018. Parker took Jekyll from 0.9.x to 3.6 and led the charge in introducing many improvements along the way, including Collections, Sass and CoffeeScript support, front matter defaults, and many other quality-of-life improvements.

Ashwin Maroli and Matt Rodgers took over after that and have pushed Jekyll forward to 4.2.1 with many bug fixes, documentation improvements, optimizations and quality of life improvements.
