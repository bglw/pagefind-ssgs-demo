    Beau Simensen was using Jekyll to create static sites and hit issues he created pull requests to fix. After months of inactivity on his pull requests, he grew frustrated and set out to build a new SSG. Beau had experience in PHP and thought, "Maybe I could rewrite Jekyll in PHP". Symfony's HTTP Kernel SSG could serve as the heart of the SSG, Composer was making waves as a PHP dependency manager, and Twig was a popular PHP templating language. He had all the building blocks he needed. And so, Sculpin was born.

Sculpin has a similar feature set to Jekyll in that you can blog, there are custom content types (Jekyll's "collections"), layouts, and the ability to extend Sculpin for your own needs.
