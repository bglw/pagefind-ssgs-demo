    Ruby on Rails was launched in August 2004, cementing Ruby as a trendy alternative to PHP for web applications.

    Fast forward a few years, and Denis Defreyne was looking for a Ruby-based blogging platform. Fortunately for the static site community, he couldn't find anything that met his requirements: "Having a VPS with only 96 MB of RAM, any Ruby-based CMS ran extremely slowly".

Denis was another pioneer of static websites, and realized his VPS would have more than enough resources if the website were purely static. He set out to build what we now know as the first modern static site generator. One year later, on May 2007, Denis launched Nanoc to the world.

Nanoc introduced many of the features we now expect in an SSG: layouts, page metadata, Markdown support, templates, and plugins.
