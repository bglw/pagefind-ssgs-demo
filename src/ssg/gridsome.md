    The success of Gatsby.js inspired Hans to create the "missing piece to the Vue.js ecosystem."

    "What Gatsby.js does for React.js is a game-changer in how we build websites. React.js is excellent, but we think Vue.js is more approachable for most web designers and devs getting started with Jamstack. Gridsome is the Vue.js alternative to Gatsby."

Gridsome takes a similar approach to Gatsby.js, using a universal GraphQL layer to connect to data sources. It also applies many of the same out-of-the-box performance optimizations such as image compressing, image lazy-loading, CSS & JS minification, code-splitting, HTML compressing, and more.
