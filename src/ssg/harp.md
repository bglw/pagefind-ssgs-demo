    Coming off the success of creating PhoneGap, a way of building mobile apps with HTML, CSS, and JS, Brock Whitten set to work on a new kind of SSG, Harp.

    The idea behind Harp is all the preprocessors are built in, so you can write your Sass CSS in a .sass file and Harp will automatically build it into a .css. It also supports Markdown, Jade, EJS, LESS, Stylus, and CoffeeScript.

Harp isn't just a static site generator, either. You can use it to 'compile' or build a site just as you would with a static site generator. You can also use it as a middleware for handling assets in a larger application, or as a production web server replacing something like Nginx or Apache.

Where Harp really shines is in its simplicity. Sure, it doesn't have some of the standard SSG features like front matter and blogging. But, if you don't need those, this is a neat little SSG. You can create Markdown files, wrap them in your HTML layout, and have your Sass automatically build.
