    Brandon Mathis's story of creating Octopress is a little unusual from the rest of the static site generators for two reasons:

    Brandon came from a design and photography background.
    Octopress isn't an SSG in its own right. In Brandon's words, "Octopress is basically some guy's Jekyll blog you can fork and modify".

In October 2009, Brandon started working on a new version of his blog. He decided to use Jekyll, built a few rake tasks, made a nice theme, and before long, his WordPress site was now a Jekyll site.

Soon after, Chris Epstein, the creator of Compass and co-creator of Sass, forked Brandon's repository and asked for some help with the design. Being a big fan of Chris's, Brandon jumped on the opportunity straight away. He pulled out the content, made the theme more generic, and named his creation Octopress.

A few years later, he decided to improve Octopress. He took a few months off work, made the theme nicer, made fancier Rake tasks and plugins, and released Octopress 2.0. It was swiftly picked up on Hacker News and became one of the top 25 most forked repositories at the time.
