    In the late 90s, self-published blogging rose in popularity thanks to tools like Blogger, Open Diary, and LiveJournal.

    Ben and Mena Trott had what they called a "[d]issatisfaction with existing blog CMSes â€” performance, stability". They decided to create their own open-source Perl-based blogging platform, which would build a purely static website after any change.

It was operated through a web GUI rather than on the command line; while it may not be what we typically think of as an SSG, the resulting website is static.

Moveable Type was one of the first platforms to recognize the advantages of static websites and make them accessible to a non-technical audience. It's powered tens of thousands of blogs and is actively maintained to this day.
