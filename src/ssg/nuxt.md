    Much like the many SSGs taking direct inspiration from Jekyll, Nuxt.js started as a Vue.js alternative to Next.js:

    The 25th of October 2016, the team behind zeit.co, announced Next.js, a framework for server-rendered React applications. A few hours after the announcement, the idea of creating server-rendered Vue.js applications the same way as Next.js was obvious: Nuxt.js was born.

Just like Next.js, Nuxt is a hybrid framework giving developers the ability to serve and deploy websites using server-side rendering (SSR), single-page apps (SPAs), or use static site generation (SSG) to build an entirely static website.

Vue.js had an answer for Next.js, propelling the rapid growth and adoption of Nuxt. To ensure the continued success and growth of Nuxt.js, Alexandre & Sébastien Chopin formed the commercial entity NuxtLabs and promptly raised $2M "to build a team of Nuxt experts working full time on Open Source and business solutions around it."

Nuxt.js powers the websites for well-known brands such as Upwork, design.gitlab.com, Ecosia, and even Nintendo's Paper Mario.
