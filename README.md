# SSG Timeline â€” SSGs through the ages

This repository was put together for [Ep. 15 of THE Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-15-intelligent-indexing-and-now-pages/). It is based on the [Eleventy Not So Minimal Blog Starter template](https://github.com/Mangamaui/eleventy-not-so-minimal-blog-starter) from [Mangamaui](https://github.com/Mangamaui), and uses content from Mike Neumegen's [SSGs through the ages](https://cloudcannon.com/blog/ssg-history-1-before-jekyll/) series on the CloudCannon Blog.
